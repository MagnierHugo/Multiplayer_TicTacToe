# TCP - Thorougly Corrupted Programming

This Project is a Tic-Tac-Toe with multiplayer using SFML, ImGui and WinSock32\
However the program is only sending packets to the localhost (127.0.0.1) so it's not "real" multiplayer

## How to run

Download the release then launch an instance of TicTacToe.exe with command line argument <Server> and two with <Client>\
Give each player a username and that's it you can now play.
