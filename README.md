# TCP - Thorougly Corrupted Programming

This Project is a Tic-Tac-Toe with multiplayer using SFML, ImGui and WinSock32
However the program is only sending packets to the localhost (127.0.0.1) so it's not "real" multiplayer

## How to run

Download the release then start one instance of server.exe and two of the client.exe
Give each player a username and that's it you can now play.
